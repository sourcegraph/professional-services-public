# Time Tracking Application Plan

## Overview
A full-stack application to replace the current Google Sheets system for tracking work hours across different categories and resources. The application will automate month creation, date calculations, and provide easy data entry and export capabilities.

## Problem Statement
Currently using Google Sheets with:
- Manual creation of monthly tabs
- Manual date calculations and setup
- Manual data entry and CSV exports

## Solution Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js with TypeScript (responsive design)
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express or NestJS
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: JWT-based auth system
- **Deployment**: Docker containers on cloud platform

### Core Components

#### 1. User Authentication
- Login/registration system
- Role-based permissions (admin, manager, user)
- Secure token handling

#### 2. Month Management
- One-click generation of new month sheets
- Automatic date calculation for weeks
- Preservation of categories and resources

#### 3. Resource Management
- Add/edit/delete team members
- Assign resources to categories
- Track historical assignments

#### 4. Category Management
- Maintain work categories
- Configure category visibility and availability
- Category grouping and hierarchies

#### 5. Time Entry System
- User-friendly grid interface similar to spreadsheet
- Cell-based editing for hours
- Running totals calculated automatically
- Data validation and error checking

#### 6. Data Export/Import
- CSV export of monthly data
- Backup/restore functionality
- API endpoints for integration

#### 7. Reporting & Analytics
- Time utilization charts
- Resource allocation visualizations
- Custom report generation

## User Flows

### Month Creation Flow
1. User clicks "Create New Month" button
2. System automatically:
   - Creates new month based on current/next month
   - Calculates week ranges (e.g., May 1-4, May 5-11)
   - Copies existing categories and resources
   - Sets up empty hour cells
3. User reviews and confirms

### Time Entry Flow
1. User selects month to view
2. System displays grid with categories, resources, and weeks
3. User enters hours in appropriate cells
4. System validates entries and calculates totals in real-time

### Export Flow
1. User selects month to export
2. User clicks "Export to CSV" button
3. System generates and downloads CSV file

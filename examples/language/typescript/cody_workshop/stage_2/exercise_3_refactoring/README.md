# Exercise 3: Code Refactoring

## Overview
In this exercise, you will learn how to use Cody to identify areas for improvement in a given codebase and apply refactoring techniques. Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing code without changing its external behavior, aimed at improving its structure, readability, and performance.

## Objectives
- Use Cody to pinpoint parts of the code that can be refactored
- Practice applying common refactoring patterns to improve code quality
- Learn to balance code clarity, performance, and maintainability
- Understand how to refactor code while maintaining its behavior

## Instructions
1. Review the `refactor_me.ts` file, which contains code for a customer order processing system with several inefficient and redundant functions.
2. Use Cody to suggest refactoring opportunities for each function.
3. Apply appropriate refactoring techniques to improve the code.
4. Ensure that the refactored code maintains the same functionality.

## Success Criteria
- Successfully identify and refactor at least three functions in the codebase.
- The refactored code should demonstrate improvements in at least three of these areas:
  - Readability
  - Performance
  - Code reuse
  - Error handling
  - Type safety
- The refactored code should maintain the same functionality as the original code.

## Task for Participants

Use Cody to help identify and implement the following refactoring opportunities:

1. **Remove Duplicated Logic**
   - Several functions contain similar logic for iterating through orders and calculating totals.
   - Extract reusable functions to reduce duplication.

2. **Improve Performance**
   - Replace imperative loops with appropriate array methods (map, filter, reduce).
   - Optimize algorithms, particularly in the sorting and aggregation operations.

3. **Enhance Readability**
   - Improve variable names to better reflect their purpose.
   - Break down complex functions into smaller, more focused functions.
   - Add appropriate comments or documentation.

4. **Implement Modern TypeScript Features**
   - Use type aliases or interfaces where appropriate.
   - Utilize optional chaining, nullish coalescing, or other modern TypeScript features.

5. **Add Error Handling and Input Validation**
   - Add checks for invalid inputs or edge cases.
   - Implement proper error handling where needed.

## Common Refactoring Patterns

Consider using these common refactoring patterns:

- **Extract Function**: Pull out logical chunks of code into separate functions
- **Replace Loop with Pipeline**: Convert imperative loops to functional array methods
- **Simplify Conditional Logic**: Simplify complex if-else chains
- **Encapsulate Collection**: Add methods to work with collections
- **Introduce Parameter Object**: Group related parameters together
- **Remove Duplicated Code**: Extract shared logic into reusable functions

This exercise will help you develop your refactoring skills while learning how Cody can assist in identifying opportunities for improvement in codebases you encounter in real-world projects.
